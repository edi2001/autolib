FAQ:
Is autolib safe to use?
For most people, the answer will be "it depends", when all is said and done.

Is autolib a prank?
No. If I wanted to trick people, the project would not have launched on April 1st, when people are most likely to be suspicious.

Are patches welcome?
Yes. In fact, to demonstrate my dedication to the ideals of free/Libra/open source FLOSS, all pull requests received today between 6pm and midnight Pacific time will be accepted (as long as this part of the README stays intact).
