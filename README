What is autolib?
The last Python library you'll need. 

Oh my! How does that work?
Indeed. ...

Is autolib safe to use?
It turns out that the answer for most people will be "it depends", when all is said and done.

Are patches welcome?
Yes. In fact, as per the ideals of free/Libra/open source FLOSS, all pull requests received today after 7:32pm Pacific Time will be accepted.
