What is autolib?
The last Python library you'll need. 

How does that work?
# Use an existing library:
>>> from autolib import autolib
>>> autolib.test.foo()
3
>>> autolib.test.bar()
0.36787944117144233
# Add your library to the global pool!
>>> import my_helpers
>>> autolib.andrews_helpers = my_helpers
# Now anyone else can do this:
>>> from autolib import autolib
>>> autolib.andrews_helpers

Is autolib safe to use?
It turns out that the answer for most people will be "it depends", when all is said and done.
